# RA.assignments
GALTON
Galton.py is the code of the assignment.
Python libraries: numpy, matplotlib, scipy.
At the bottom of the code there are all the variables that can be modified to show different plots and simulations.
N and n are respectively the number of balls and the number of bins used for the distribution plot.
N_values and n_values are different numbers of balls and bins used for the error plot between empirical and theoretical distributions.
Once run, the program will show three differents plots, one after the other.
At line 92 it is possible to uncomment to print the MSEs between empirical and theoretical distributions on the terminal.

BALANCED ALLOCATION
Balanced_Allocation.py is the code for the first methods with full information.
Balanced_Allocation2.py is the code for the b-batching setting.
Balanced_Allocation3.py is the code for the partial information setting.
All 3 codes have assignments to the variables n,m,beta,d and k at the beginning of the code, and can be modified.
The program run in Python will show the plots displayed in the PDF.
