# RA.assignments
Galton.py is the code of the assignment.
Python libraries: numpy, matplotlib, scipy.
At the bottom of the code there are all the variables that can be modified to show different plots and simulations.
N and n are respectively the number of balls and the number of bins used for the distribution plot.
N_values and n_values are different numbers of balls and bins used for the error plot between empirical and theoretical distributions.
Once run, the program will show three differents plots, one after the other.
At line 92 it is possible to uncomment to print the MSEs between empirical and theoretical distributions on the terminal.
